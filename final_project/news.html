            <h1>Wentworth Women are Building a Network and Thriving in Male-Dominated Fields</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            Deanna Kondek was a sophomore in high school when she won first prize in a bridge-building competition. “Then I heard
        from someone, ‘It’s gonna be hard for you to be an engineer as a woman,’” she recalls.
        
        Words to that effect have been far too common for many women in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
        (STEM) fields. We spoke with nine women who have been active in college and share, in their words, their experiences
        with not only persevering as a woman in STEM, but even thriving at a school like Wentworth.

                <h1>How Wentworth is Leading the Way with the Idea of the Embedded Classroom</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
            On a weekday during the spring semester, a group of Wentworth students head to Boston’s Prudential Center. They’re not
            going to shop, dine, or work—not in the traditional sense anyway.
            
            They’re going to class.
            
            Specifically, they are heading to Industrial Design Studio. The course, which meets twice weekly for three-hour sessions
            and is offered to juniors and seniors, has been most-recently located at the headquarters of health insurer Blue Cross
            Blue Shield of Massachusetts, where Wentworth faculty member Matthew Templeton has spent the last three years as the
            organization’s senior director of innovation, strategy, and business solutions.
            
            Students of this class, which focuses on “design thinking,” get the unique opportunity to network with anyone from
            professional project managers to top executives at Blue Cross, while working on real projects to the benefit of the
            organization.
            
            Templeton loosely refers to this as the “embedded classroom.” Here, he says, education goes from theoretical to
            experiential, from abstract to immersive.
            
            “At Wentworth, all the professors are practitioners,” he says. “They actually have boots on the ground. As an educator
            here, nothing is just theory.”

                <h1>Boston Globe Looks at How Wentworth Students are Hoping to Save Roxbury Church</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                As the pastor of money-strapped Eliot Congregational Church in Roxbury, Evan Hines has been looking at creative ways to
                save his beloved church.
                
                Reporter Laura Krantz documents in the Boston Globe how Wentworth Architecture students looked at reuse options and
                presented those ideas to the Eliot congregation, as well as how the church represents a strong piece of the overall
                Roxbury community.
